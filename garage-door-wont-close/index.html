If the issue is with the sensors youll likely find that you can use the garage door remote or wall-mounted switch to open the door but not to close it. Sometimes you can override this issue by holding down the switch until the door closes completely. 3 Fixes For A Garage Door That Won T Close Garage Doors Garage Door Types Garage Door Styles.</p>
