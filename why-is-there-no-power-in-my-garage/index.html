<p>Theres no crime in finding out the working in your house its just that electricity is a killer no matter how simple it may seem thats why when we work on an installation we have to put our name on a piece of paper that says we accept responsibility if it goes wrong also if we give you advice other than call someone in thats competent and something goes wrong and you electricute yourself or the place. Unless of course you have a second meter but that would show up on your power bill as a 2nd service. I did test the voltage again it went up to 230v at the main garage board near main electric supply tested the switch and garage showing same voltage but still nothing is working in the garage. GFCI devices often protect the outlet circuit that is installed into the garage therefore if this device trips off then garage outlets will be affected.</p>

<p>If this is unsuccessful there is damage to the system that must be repaired by a professional. Some have the breakers on a side access door but this is where you should find your disconnect since turning off your main did not kill the power. It is not recommended to use a switch to power the garage door opener onoff as repetitive power cycling may damage the operators receiver logic board. It can be identified by test and reset buttons on its face. Bike Workshop Ktm Enduro Bike Workshop.</p>

<p>Its also possible that the supply to the garage has been run from one of the houses sockets circuits via a Fused Connection Unit FCU aka fused switch somewhere - if that were he case the fuse may have blown or it might even have got switched off. So you shut off your main panels main breaker and your garage didnt trip. Went back and tested again at the main garage board it has dropped to 210v also the same readings down the line till the garage.

<p>It means if you overloaded the garage circuit say running a saw and dust collector and the saw hangs up on a knot then the breaker that would trip is not in your main panel. Anyway once you rule out the GFCI and the circuit breaker you then check for power at the receptacles. There is power to the rest of the house.
