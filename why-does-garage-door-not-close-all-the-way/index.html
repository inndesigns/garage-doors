<p>If one of them is off or blinking it means the invisible beam that tells the opener that the way is clear for the door to close isnt aligned.

The photo-eye components consist of two pieces that align face-to-face across each side of the garage door roughly four feet above the ground. This button is to prevent the door from opening or closing using the hand-held remote. How To Repair A Garage Door Opener Garage Door Opener Repair Garage Door Repair Garage Door Maintenance.</p>
