<p>This model looks like it is new and I would first check the balance of the door by closing the door and releasing it from the opener and lifting the door by hand to waist lever and releasing it to see if it stays in that position or if it slams to the floor.

<p>Sometimes you need to adjust the garage door. If you operate your door manually and the door will not go all the way down dont force it. A garage door that hangs halfway today might be one that wont open at all tomorrow or falls on you or your car the next time you try to get out of your garage. If the door goes up but you cant make it go down you probably need to adjust the sensors.
