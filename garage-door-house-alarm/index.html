<p>I have an Overhead Door brand Model 65A garage door opener that works fine at the switch but the remote stopped working unless you get right up to the garage door. It was set by the installer at the time of the build and has always worked. If you do decide to connect your garage door to the alarm system choosing where on the door to install the switch is an important consideration. Purchase junction boxes for use with hard wired home security systems including the 6-way junction box and garage alarms designed to protect vulnerable doors against forced entry.
