<p>If youre pressing the button on your garage door opener remote and the door only occasionally responds to your commands your transmitter signal is likely weak due to dying batteries. Everyone gets busy and loses track of home or garage maintenance tasks at some point or another. I have a Viper 791 remote start alarm. I never had to change it this often before. 2.</p>

<p>Your garage door isnt opening at all your batteries could have died or the signal is so weak it isnt registering Be Careful If your remote has blinking lights there is a chance it has a motion detector on it which means it could drain the battery faster if it is registering motion constantly. Most commonly the garage door opener remotes use cellular batteries. My goal is to be able to press a button on a remote and cause an actuator to open and close without running through a million batteries every five minutes. If so it could be a sign that your batteries have died and the remote is unable.
