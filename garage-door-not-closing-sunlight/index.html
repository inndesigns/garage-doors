<p>We purchased a garage door with keypad from Sears and have noticed that when the door itself is in the direct sunlight - late morning all the way until late afternoon you have to hold down the button on either the keypad or the button inside the garage by the door to the house until the garage door is all the way down - or else it will act like there is something in the way and start to close but then go. If for some reason you do have direct sunlight on your sensors then thats something you can try. Garage doors operate as a system and several things could cause your door to not close in the. Everything Ive read says this is because the safety sensors are misaligned blinded by direct sunlight or bad somehow.</p>

<p>I aligned the sensors and it worked fine. My garage door will start to close then reverse. Garage Door wont close on sunny days. If you are having issues closing your garage door when there is a lot of sunlight shining into the garage you might need to check to see which safety sensor is in the sunlight. I can sometimes get it to close fully by having my shadow fall across the sensor and closing the garage door but even that only works some of the time.</p>
