<p>On a properly functioning garage door there are springs in place to make the garage door close slowly instead of slamming down. If your garage door is falling down when closing you should look to replace the springs. If the light is off the sensor itself is probably off and if the light is blinking it means something is getting in the way of the signal. Typically the LEDs on the safety sensors will blink to indicate that the problem is an obstruction. If this problem keeps reoccurring and the door wont shut simply press and hold the wall button continually until the door is fully closed.</p>

<p>We purchased a garage door with keypad from Sears and have noticed that when the door itself is in the direct sunlight - late morning all the way until late afternoon you have to hold down the button on either the keypad or the button inside the garage by the door to the house until the garage door is all the way down - or else it will act like there is something in the way and start to close but then go. Garage door wont close in the morning. If you have managed to close the door proceed to step 6. A good way to see if this is whats wrong with your door is make sure nothing is blocking the door from closing and hold down the wall mounted button inside your garage.

<p>Some solutions I have heard including fashioning blinders around the sensors or swapping sides so that the receiving eye is at a different angle. If you have managed to close the door proceed to step 6. As soon as the door passes the sensors line the sunlight wont interfere with the beam anymore and the door will remain shut. A good way to see if this is whats wrong with your door is make sure nothing is blocking the door from closing and hold down the wall mounted button inside your garage.
