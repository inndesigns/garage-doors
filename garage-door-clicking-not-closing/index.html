<p>Garage door opener safety sensors can go bad due to age excess sun. If the sensors are hindered by anything including something as simple as leaves or other debris the garage door opener will emit clicking sounds but the door will not open or close. Although wiring the switch together should have told it that there was no obstruction headbang. The pattern repeats itself until the garage door reaches its UP limit. If your garage door wont close after aligning the safety sensors you might need to replace them.</p>
