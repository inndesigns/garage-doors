<p>Im doing the trim on an interior door and the sheetrock sticks out beyond the door frame so that the trim will not meet up flush with the frame. The door closes flush to the bottom of the floor.

<p>We tore our living room down to the studs last fall and had new drywall put up. The addition of windows to your door can transform your garage by adding more natural light and making the space seem larger and brighter. We have products in stock to close a gap up to about 2 inches on either side of the door. There is about a 1-12 gap. Flush Design From Garaga Garage Doors.</p>
